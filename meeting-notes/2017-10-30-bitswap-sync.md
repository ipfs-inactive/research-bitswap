### David's update:
 - teaching has become more time consuming
 - developing the simulation stuff more
 - continuing planning/prep for bitswap strategy competition for 2018
   - Evan and David agreed that delving into theory (SMT solvers or Renormalization Group) is likely less practical than simulations
 - continuing to write bitswap spec
 - thinking more about game theory, writing up a .tex summary
