In this document, we analyze 3 strategies for a simple 2-player Bitswap
infinitely repeated game.

**TODO**: finish this intro. Might want to mention the paragraph below, but have
to be clear that the first section is more general than the specific case done
in the analysis

In a given round, a player's utility is dependent on the actions each of the
players took in the previous round -- in other words, the debt ratio only
considers the immediately preceding round, rather than all previous rounds.

Actions and Utility Functions
=============================

A player has two possible actions: reciprocate ($R$) or defect ($D$). The
utility function for player $i$ at time $t$ $u_i^t$:

$$
u_i^t = \sum_{j \in \Nbhd{i}} \delta_{a_j^{t}R} S_j(d_{ji}, \mathbf{d}_j^{-i}) B
         - \delta_{a_i^t R} B \\
$$

where

-   $\Nbhd{i}$ is the neighborhood of user $i$ (i.e.Â the set of peers $i$ is
    connected to)
-   $a_i^t \in \{R, D\}$ is the action user $i$ takes in round $t$
-   $\delta{ij}$ is the kronecker delta function
-   $d_{ji}^t$ is the reputation of user $i$ as viewed by peer $j$ (also
    referred to as the *debt ratio* from $i$ to $j$) in round $t$
-   $S_j(d_{ij}, \mathbf{d}_j^{-i}) \in \{0, 1\}$ is the *strategy function* of
    user $j$. This function considers the relative reputation of peer $i$ to the
    rest of $j$'s peers, and returns a weight for peer $i$. This weight is used
    to determine what proportion of $j$'s bandwidth to give to peer $i$.
-   $B$ is the (constant) amount of bandwidth that a user has to offer in a
    given round. We make the simplifying assumption that the users are
    homogeneous in this value, so they all have the same amount of bandwidth to
    offer.

The terms *strategy* and *strategy function* are defined as:

-   A *strategy* is meant in the standard game-theoretical sense, which is a
    predetermined set of actions that a user will take in a game (potentially
    dependent on that user's previous payoffs, the actions of its peers, etc.).
-   A *strategy function* is a term used to specify the weighting function that
    a user uses when running the Bitswap protocol to determine how much
    bandwidth it wants to allocate to each of its peers whenever it's playing
    the $R$ strategy.

Putting this all together, we see that the utility of peer $i$ in round $t$ is
the total amount of bandwidth that $i$ is allocated by its neighboring peers,
minus the amount of bandwidth that $i$ provides to its peers. If $i$
reciprocates, then we say that they provide a total of $B$ bandwidth to the
network; otherwise (when $i$ defects), $i$ provides $0$ bandwidth in that round.

We can write the debt ratio $d_{ij}$ in terms of the number of bits exchanged
between peers $i$ and $j$:

$$
d_{ji}^t = \frac{b_{ji}^{t-1}}{b_{ij}^{t-1} + 1}
$$

where $b_{ij}^{t-1}$ is the total number of bits sent from $i$ to $j$ from round
$0$ through round $t-1$ (so, all rounds prior to round $t$).

We can define $b_{ij}^{t+1}$ in terms of $b_{ij}^{t}$ and $\delta_{a_i^t R}$ as
follows:


$$
b_{ij}^{t+1} = b_{ij}^t + \delta_{a_i^t R} S_i(d_{ij}, \mathbf{d}_i^{-j}) B
$$

So, the total number of bits sent from $i$ to $j$ increases by
$S_i(d_{ij}, \mathbf{d}_i^{-j}) B$ (the proportion of $i$'s total bandwidth that
$i$ allocates to $j$) if and only if peer $i$ reciprocated in round $t$ (i.e.,
$a_i^t = R \implies \delta_{a_i^t R} = 1$).

Now we can write $d_{ij}^{t+1}$ in terms of values from round $t$.

$$
d_{ij}^{t+1} = \frac{b_{ij}^{t}
                  + \delta_{a_i^t R} S_i(d_{ij}, \mathbf{d}_i^{-j}) B}
               {b_{ji}^t + \delta_{a_j^t R} S_j(d_{ji}, \mathbf{d}_j^{-i}) B + 1}
$$

Analysis
========

The strategy function that user $j$ will use to weight some peer $i$ is:

$$
S_j(d_{ji}, \mathbf{d}_j^{-i}) = \frac{d_{ji}}
    {\sum_{k \in \Nbhd{j}} d_{jk}}
$$



$$
u_i^t = \sum_{j \in \Nbhd{i}} \frac{\delta_{a_j^{t}R} d_{ji}^t}
             {\sum_{k \in \Nbhd{j}} d_{jk}^t} B
         - \delta_{a_i^t R} B \\
$$

**TODO**: Mention that $d_{ij}^t$ only considers previous round (and ensure
explanation is consistent with analysis below)

We now consider 3 strategies: tit-for-tat, pavlov, and grim-trigger. For each of
these, we'll determine whether the strategy is an subgame-perfect Nash
equilibrium (SPNE) for the 2-player infinitely repeated game.

Tit-for-Tat
-----------

We start by analyzing the well-studed tit-for-tat (TFT) strategy. A peer that
uses this strategy always takes the strategy that their peer took in the
previous round. So, if player 1 plays action $R$ ($D$) in round $t$, then player
2 will play action $R$ in round $t+1$ ($D$), and vice-versa.

To determine whether TFT is an SPNE for the 2-player infinitely repeated
(simplified) Bitswap game, we will do the following:

-   Consider an initial pair of actions at $t=0$, $(a_1^0, a_2^0)$.
-   Assume player 1 plays TFT for all rounds.
-   Consider two cases:
    1.  Player 2 never deviates from TFT.
    2.  Player 2 deviates from TFT for a single round, at $t=1$, then plays TFT
        for all future rounds.
-   Compare player 2's payoff for the infinitely-repeated game. If player 2's
    payoff in case 2 (when they deviate from TFT) is less than or equal to their
    payoff in case 1 (when they don't) for all initial pairs of actions, then
    TFT is an SPNE.

Let's look at the case where the initial pair of actions is $(D, D)$.

### $(D, D)$ at $t=0$

Here, both players start by playing the $D$ strategy. We'll first consider the
case where player 2 does not deviate from TFT. The strategies at each round then
follow:

 $t$     $0$ $1$ $2$ $3$ $4$ ...
------   --- --- --- --- --- ---
$a_1^t$   D   R   D   R   D  ...
$a_2^t$   R   D   R   D   R  ...

**TODO**: describe the resulting pattern and payoff in each case

**TODO**: show total payoff calculating

**TODO**: summarize results for each other pair of initial conditions
